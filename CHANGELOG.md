### February 18, 2012

### January 8, 2012
 * Should now have an easier time automatically finding OpenCV libraries inside standard directories such as `/usr/local/lib/`, `/opt/local/lib/`, and `C:\opencv\`, even when they are not part of the system configuration or PATH
 * New `PS3EyeFrameGrabber` from Jiri Masa can now grab images using the SDK from Code Laboratories

### October 1, 2011
 * Fixed `DC1394FrameGrabber` and `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber` to behave as expected with all Bayer/Raw/Mono/RGB/YUV cameras modes (within the limits of libdc1394 and PGR FlyCapture)

### August 21, 2011
 * Upgraded support to OpenCV 2.3.1
 * `OpenCVFrameGrabber` now detects when CV_CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC is broken and gives up calling `cvGetCaptureProperty()`

 * Fixed `OpenKinectFrameGrabber` and `FFmpegFrameGrabber`

### June 10, 2011

 * The Unix scripts now check for a 64-bit JVM in priority

### May 11, 2011
 * Changed `Marker.getCenter()` back to the centroid, because it has better noise averaging properties and gives in practice more accurate results than the actual center
 * Added hack to `OpenCVFrameGrabber.start()` to wait for `cvRetrieveFrame()` to return something else than `null` under Mac OS X
 * Added to the scripts `-Dapple.awt.fullscreencapturealldisplays=false` Java option required for full-screen support under Mac OS X 
 * Removed from the scripts the default `-Dsun.java2d.opengl=True` Java option, because since NVIDIA Release 260 family of drivers, most video drivers under Linux do not have good OpenGL support anymore
 * `FFmpegFrameGrabber` now works properly on Windows with newer binaries
 * New `VideoInputFrameGrabber` to capture using DirectShow, useful under Windows 7 where OpenCV and FFmpeg can fail to capture using Video for Windows
 * `GeometricCalibrator` now reports the maximum errors in addition to the average (RMS) errors

### April 7, 2011
 * Added a `format` property to camera settings, mostly useful for `FFmpegFrameGrabber`, where interesting values include "dv1394", "mjpeg", "video4linux2", "vfwcap", and "x11grab"
 * Added hack to make sure the temporarily extracted library files get properly deleted under Windows

### February 19, 2011
 * Upgraded to the latest version of JavaCV based on JavaCPP instead of JNA, featuring better performance
 * Tried to fix image format conversion inside `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber`, but this is going to require more careful debugging

### November 4, 2010
 * Renamed the package namespace to `com.googlecode.javacv.procamcalib`, which makes more sense now that JavaCV has been well anchored at Google Code for more than a year, piggybacking on the unique and easy-to-remember domain name, but this means you will need to manually edit any old XML `settings.pcc` files and rename the namespace of the classes inside
 * `CanvasFrame` now redraws its `Canvas` after the user resizes the `Frame`
 * Added check to `DC1394FrameGrabber` so that a "Failed to initialize libdc1394" does not crash the JVM
 * `FrameGrabber` now selects the default grabber a bit better
 * Included Mac OS X 10.6.4 binaries for ARToolKitPlus compiled by Christian Parsons

 * Fixed speed setting problem with the `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber`

### April 16, 2010
 * Modified a few things to get better default behavior of gamma correction
 * Camera setting `triggerFlushSize` now defaults to 5 (only affects `OpenCVFrameGrabber` and `FFmpegFrameGrabber`)
 * Fixed missing updates when changing some settings

### April 8, 2010
 * Added support for OpenCV 2.1

### April 5, 2010
 * Some bugs fixed for FFmpeg

### March 21, 2010
 * Added to camera settings a `deviceFile` field that can bring up a file dialog
 * Added `triggerFlushSize` to indicate the number of buffers to flush for cheap camera that keep old images in memory indefinitely
 * The size and spacing of markers inside MarkerPatterns can now be adjusted separately in X and Y
 * Fixed distortion problem with color calibration when running with OpenCV 1.1pre1

### February 13, 2010
 * Added `FFmpegFrameGrabber` to capture images using FFmpeg 0.5
 * Fixed corruption of distortion coefficients that could occur

### December 22, 2009
 * Sync with new JavaCV, no functional changes to ProCamCalib itself

### November 24, 2009
 * Fixed some crashy crashy behavior
 * Added R2 correlation coefficient for color calibration as indicator of good accuracy
 * `useMarkerCenters` now uses the actual physical center of each marker instead of the centroid

### October 19, 2009
 * Added color calibration

### October 14, 2009
 * Upgraded JavaCV to work with OpenCV 2.0 in addition to 1.1pre1
